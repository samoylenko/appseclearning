# Learning Application Security

This project was created in collaboration with Will Ascuitto - we decided to start
collecting notes from our conversations about sharing our knowledge with
colleagues who are just starting their professional career in application
security.

This document contains a list of items which we think may help build the
required skills and knowledge quickly. We also share our practical,
real-world experience and advice with those who want to make a difference and
become and information security professionals able to productively interact with
development teams - a skill which is currently in a very high demand.

## What to learn (and why)

1.  Application Security skills
    1.  Theory
        1.  [OWASP TOP-10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project)

        The top common application security vulnerabilities list. You will often see that
        for many of our colleagues, application security starts and
        ends here. However, this list is just the beginning.

        1.  [MITRE CWE (Common Weaknesses Enumeration)](https://cwe.mitre.org)

        Knowledge base on security weaknesses. Vulnerabilities that are found
        by security researchers are commonly mapped against CWE IDs - this is
        a practice that we recommend to ensure having a common ground with all
        parties involved in the vulnerability resolution process.

        3.  [OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project)

        Great guide on what and how to look for in applications.

        4.  [Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540)

        HTTP is the protocol web applications use to communicate. Knowledge of
        this protocol is essential for every application security professional.

    2.  Practice
        1.  Complete these challenges to see common vulnerabilities in action:
            1.  [OWASP WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat)

            WebGoat has great tutorials and will guide you through everything.
             Its development version also teaches you how to fix common
             vulnerabilities in Java Web Applications. Additional lessons are
             available at [GitHub](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat-Lessons).

            2.  [OWASP JuiceShop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop)

            JuiceShop is a good example of modern 'single-page'
            application, and it's challenges are fun!

        2.  Learn to use this tool, it's very useful:
            1.  [OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy)
                (or [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) - commercial
                analogue, extremely popular, and adequately priced)

            These tools are useful for looking into how web applications
            work and for finding and reproducing potential vulnerabilities.
            Use them while playing with WebGoat or JuiceShop - it's
            highly recommended!

2.  Programming skills:

    We think that an application security professional must
    have development skills. In the modern world of applications development,
    security is not about generic solutions - at least, not anymore. An application
    security professional is expected not only to detect security issues, but also 
    to resolve and/or prevent them. Most of the popular programming
    frameworks have security controls built-in; however, they are often not
    properly implemented by developers.

    **It is no longer the case that developers need to implement security
    controls from scratch. Custom security implmentation and not using the functionality 
    provided by modern frameworks/well-known libraries will commonly be the root cause 
    for many security issues you will work with.**

    1.  Main programming language: **Java**

        Widely used by the enterprise, it's not going away anytime soon.
        Unlike **.Net / C#**, it's free to use and learn. Also, it's not
        restricted to  the Microsoft stack. Combined with a widespread community 
        of helpful and friendly developers, Java is a great first lanaguage to learn.

        If you don't like Java, our other recommendation would be **Go**, but
        it's not currently very popular in the world of enterprise.

        1.  Use a dependency management (build) tool to write your programs. 
            Never download dependencies manually.

            For Java, we recommend **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)**. A great
            alternative would be [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), but it's not yet
            widely adopted by entherprise.

            Start your first java project by running `mvn mvn archetype:generate`
            and selecting the default template it offers
            (`maven-archetype-quickstart`).

        2.  **[Spring](http://spring.io/)** is probably the best Java framework
        to begin with. It is a popular way to quickly build web applications.

        This book is useful for getting started with Spring -
        "[Spring in action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-fourth-edition)".
        This is a good opportunity for us to stress that
        **reading reference manuals** will help make you a better security professional,
        so we recommend that you to read Spring reference documentation in addition to the book.

        We consider this to be the **hardest item to learn on this list**, so
        allow some time for reading and practice. The knowledge and
        practice obtained while learning Spring will make you
        stand out as an application security professional.


    2. Scripting language (secondary programming language): **ECMAScript aka
       JavaScript** (specifically, **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)**)

       In addition to their main programming langunage, a security professional
       will need to write scripts: this can be a quick test, some
       automation, or even a solution that injects security into a build
       pipeline. Scripting commonly involves items the operating system level
       (working with files, directories, running binaries etc) which are not
       best addressed by Java or, say, C#.

       We recommend JavaScript for many reasons - it has become extremely
       popular in the recent years, and it's much more convenient than Python,
       the former champion in this space. JavaScript is also a major
       component of any web and mobile application.


    3. Version Control System (**[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**)

       Git is essential to know by anyone who is involved in application
       development.

       Git is easy to start with:

       1. There is a free book: https://git-scm.com/doc
       2. There is a very cool tutorial: https://try.github.io


    4. Use [Lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) and code
       quality control

       We decided to include this section because these tools
       are fast, stable, easy-to-use, and help writing quality, *secure* code. 
       You can consider these tools 'cheating' if you like - 
       if you happen to review someone else's code, these tools do help a lot.

       There are authors of document use the following tools:
       1. [SonarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) - a free IDE plugin that
          checks code quality and highlights potential bugs
       2. We use [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as our IDE -
          it has embedded code inspections and features which are helpful
          during code reviews
       3. [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) - for JavaScript, as part of automatic
          builds and collaboration
       4. And we probably should mention
          [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) which we use to
          collaborate on this project

5.  Infrastructure skills:

    Let us throw a word '
    [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)' in this text - it
    is becoming widely adopted by many companies, and the authors of this document are
    big fans of this approach.

    Application security professionals will need to be familiar with DevOps, which
    includes some knowledge of infrastructure - specifically, operation systems
    and various cloud providers.

    Here's the list of we recommend to learn:

    1.  **Linux** - free operating system. Our recommendation is to start with
        [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) (easy to use and learn) or
        [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) (it's very similar to RedHat, widely
        used by enterprise)

        We should also mention that we use Linux a lot, and even at Windows
        environments we have [CygWin](https://cygwin.com) installed - it
        provides access to vital linux binaries (such as
        [curl](https://curl.haxx.se), for example)

        Note that cygwin installation does not require admin rights for
        installation if run with -B command line parameter: `setup-x86_64.exe
        -B`

    2.  **[Docker](https://www.docker.com)** - Docker is a solution which allows
        applications to be packaged into containers so that all dependencies are
        taken care of, and allows the user to run the container
        instead of spending hours or maybe days in
        [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

    3.  **[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)** - very popular
        provider for cloud services
